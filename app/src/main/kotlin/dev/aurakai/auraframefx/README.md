# org.openapitools.client - Kotlin client library for AeGenesis API (Stub Redirect)

This is a stub placeholder. The authoritative unified spec is now ASSEMBLED from fragments.

Source of truth:

- Fragments: app/api/_fragments/_*.yml (paths + core-schemas.yml)
- Assembly Task: ./gradlew openApiAssembleUnified
- Generated Output: build/openapi/unified-aegenesis-api.generated.yml

Rationale:
Fragment model reduces drift, centralizes shared schemas, and enables CI gating (openApiEnforce).

Do NOT add new endpoints here. Instead:

1. Create/edit a fragment in app/api/_fragments (or extend existing domain file).
2. Run: ./gradlew openApiAssembleUnified
3. Commit fragment + (optionally) generated spec artifact if distribution requires.

For validation & enforcement:

- ./gradlew openApiAudit
- ./gradlew openApiFragmentHealth
- ./gradlew openApiEnforce (runs in CI via check dependency)

## Overview

This API client was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By
using the [openapi-spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can
easily generate an API client.

- API version: 1.0.0
- Package version:
- Generator version: 7.15.0
- Build package: org.openapitools.codegen.languages.KotlinClientCodegen

## Requires

* Kotlin 1.7.21
* Gradle 7.5

## Build

First, create the gradle wrapper script:

```
gradle wrapper
```

Then, run:

```
./gradlew check assemble
```

This runs all tests and packages the library.

## Features/Implementation Notes

* Supports JSON inputs/outputs, File inputs, and Form inputs.
* Supports collection formats for query parameters: csv, tsv, ssv, pipes.
* Some Kotlin and Java types are fully qualified to avoid conflicts with types defined in OpenAPI
  definitions.
* Implementation of ApiClient is intended to reduce method counts, specifically to benefit Android
  targets.
